Repository for AspireNex Internship on Artificial Intelligence.

Hi guys!

My name is Aakash Praveen of Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science, Kochi, Kerala

The two tasks i have chosen for the Artificial Intelligence Internship is 
+ CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
+ FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION


CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES


The chatbot is implemented along with a restaurant website. The chatbot called MOMO is used to improve the customer experience of the restaurant. 

This chatbot is developed with the help of watsonx Assistant which was developed by myself as part of the IBM Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals Internship course.

The chatbot is developed based on basic if-else conditions and is very user friendly and interactive.

The website is also functional (payment functionality not added).

To access the website please select index2.html from the CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES folder.

The video demo of the working of the chatbot has been provided in the CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES folder.


FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION

This project was developed as part of our B.Tech Semester 6 Mini Project where the topic we choose was "Drowsiness Detection and Alert System".

The system is used to detect the face using openCV, dlib, imutils and the eye regions are determined are determined and extracted to calculate the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR).

Twilio has also been used for the basic alert SMS system which sends and alert message to their respective emergency contact as soon they are drowsy driving for above the safety limit.

Active Face Detection is done with the help of the built in landmarking models in dlib, openCV is used for processing and manipulating images while the imutils is used for resizing and enhancing the effeciency of the facial landmark detection.

This has beem implemented and verified by our advisors and judges, and is currently chosen as one of the candidates for the best projects in the current semester (results not out).

The video and photos of the functioning of the system will be provided in the FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION folder.
